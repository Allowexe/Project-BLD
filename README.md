<h2 style="text-align: center">A simulation of an airport gestion software in C</h2>
<h3>The instructions were :</h3>

- The structures were imposed.
- A limited number of parking spots, so that no planes could land when they're full.
- Every plane, before takeoff, **is required** to make it's way through a line.
- This same line has also a limited number of spots.
- A plane, depending of it's category, will be able to land on the corresponding runway, and **only** on this one.
- The database should be composed of **at least 50 differents data**.
- Any usage of a graphical library is **forbidden**.<br><br>

<h3>Overall, what did we managed to do ?</h3>

<p> Over the 3 weeks period, we managed to finish the project. Everything going from the detection of the parking slots, the runways and the taxis is perfectly functionnal. In addition, we created a startup animation, completed by a dynamicaly allocated airport simulation, both visible in the shell.</p>
